                <h2>Steven Universe (2013)</h2>
                <p>Steven Universe is an American animated television series created by <a href="findout.html">Rebecca Sugar</a> for 
                    Cartoon Network. It tells the coming-of-age story of a young boy, Steven Universe, who lives with the Crystal 
                    Gems‚Äîmagical, mineral-based aliens named Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. In the early series, the story gradually 
                    reveals that the Crystal Gems are fugitives from a great interstellar empire. 
                    During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. 
                    The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter 
                    are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. 
                    By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to 
                    incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful 
                    rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for 
                    millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys 
                    Peridot and Jasper. Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem 
                    "geo-weapon" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper
                    is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink 
                    Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem 
                    empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final 
                    season, Steven learns that in fact his mother was Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose 
                    Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage 
                    they have caused.</p>

                <h2>Steven Universe: The Movie (2019)</h2>
                <p>Steven Universe: The Movie is a 2019 American animated musical television film based on the animated television series 
                    Steven Universe created by <a href="findout.html">Rebecca Sugar</a>. After an introduction from the Diamonds, Steven 
                    Universe, now 16 years old, greets the citizens of the Gem Empire. The Diamonds want him to stay to fulfill his 
                    mother Pink Diamond's role as a leader ("Let Us Adore You"), but he refuses. Back on Earth, the Crystal Gems 
                    celebrate their newfound peace ("Happily Ever After"). Almost immediately, a giant drill lands on the hillside, 
                    and Spinel, a deranged and cartoonish Gem, appears, announcing her intent to kill Steven and the rest of the Earth.
                    Using a scythe-like weapon, she "poofs" Pearl, Garnet, and Amethyst back into their gem forms; her attacks also 
                    weaken Steven's Gem powers, though his body is unharmed. Steven manages to poof Spinel with the scythe. Along the 
                    way, he learns Spinel was a friend of his mother Pink Diamond/Rose Quartz that she abandoned for Earth thousands of 
                    years ago, hence Spinel's vendetta.</p>

                <h2>Steven Universe Future (2019)</h2>
                <p>Steven Universe Future is an American animated limited series created by <a href="findout.html">Rebecca Sugar</a> for 
                    Cartoon Network. It serves as both an epilogue and the de facto sixth and final season of the 2013‚Äì2019 original series 
                    Steven Universe and its follow-up 2019 animated film Steven Universe: The Movie. The series is set after the events of 
                    Steven Universe: The Movie, which itself takes place two years after the Steven Universe series finale "Change Your 
                    Mind". In "Change Your Mind", teenage protagonist Steven persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem 
                    empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the 
                    planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community 
                    on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to "Little 
                    Homeschool," and educating those who do not know how to find their new place in the galaxy. Steven Universe Future 
                    follows Steven's everyday life trying to help Gems find new purpose; it also depicts the disappointments he faces with
                    his new life, including the realization that there are things he cannot fix, and his own feelings of aimlessness after
                    successfully liberating the Gem empire. He confronts old foes who are looking for revenge, tries to master a new power 
                    that he doesn't fully understand, and is challenged to decide what he wants for his own future.</p>
